'''

URLify - Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. 
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, 
and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	• Edit starting from the end and go backwards allows us to change characters without worrying about over writing
	• Scan for number of spaces to replace and compute how much space we would need.
	• In the second pass, start backwards, edit string by replacing the space with '%20'
